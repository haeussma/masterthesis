# Discussion

Discuss both viewpoints: biologist and RSE.

## Reproducibility in enzyme kinetics

- Need for documentation without limiting experimental possibilities

## Data management / lab digitalization

- temperature in MTPs

## Jupyter notebooks

- great documentation (FAIR)

In this project, a robust and FAIR workflow from analytical raw-data to kinetic parameters was established. Thereby, the output of a analytical device was used directly as the input of the modeling pipeline.

Despite the robust workflow, after the data is written to an EnzymeML document, manual copying of data into the EnzymeML spreadsheet is prone to human error. Especially, for large datasets with many time points and reactants. Hence, manufacturers should enable direct access to the measurement device, for instance via an API. (Control and laer experiments)

Despite the easy applicability of the workflow, after the data is initialized,

## Current state in kinetic modeling of enzyme kinetics

## Model selection in enzyme kinetics: calibration and kinetic model

- Best-practices kinetic modeling
  - initial rates vs progress-curve analysis
    - initial rates not suited to estimate conversion after 24 h.
- Cost of additional parameters
- Model selection criteria
- How to assess the quality of a model
  - what does the model represent (not newtonian mechanics)

## Inactivation

- deterioration during catalysis
- adsorption to MTP surface (hydrophobic interaction)

## Percision of kinetic parameters

- how percise should parameters be
- randomized order in MTPs
