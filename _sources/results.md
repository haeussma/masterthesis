# Results

The development of the workflow was driven by different research scenarios, which are discussed in this chapter. Each scenario, had its specific requirements how and what kinetic parameters should be estimated from the raw data. Therefore, the software tools were developed to consider the needs of different experimental approaches.

## Workflow

Absorbance data + standard curve --> concentration data --> parameter estimation --> parameteres
