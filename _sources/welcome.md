# Welcome to my master thesis

This JupyterBook contains my master thesis. It contains multiple JupyterNotebooks in which I applied the workflow for kinetic parameter estimation of enzyme reactions on research scenarios of the EnzymeML project.

Except for this page and the capability to execute the JupyterNotebooks, the printed version is identical to this JupyterBook.
