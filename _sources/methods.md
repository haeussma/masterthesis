# Methods

## 1. EnzymeML

In its core, EnzymeML is a data model, structuring data and metadata of biocatalytic reactions. Thereby, information on reaction conditions, substrate and product measurement data, as well as estimated kinetic parameters are documented {cite}`pleiss2021standardized`. Additionally, the enzyme and the reactants are specified by protein sequence or InChI respectively, enabling clear description of all involved species in an enzyme reaction. EnzymeML is based on the ontology of Systems Biology Markup Language {cite}`hucka2003systems` and adheres to STRENDA guidelines {cite}`tipton2014standards`, which define minimal reporting standards for enzymatic experiments. Hence, EnzymeML serves as an exchange format for biocatalytic data between experimentalist, modelers and database providers, which is compliant with FAIR data principles {cite}`wilkinson2016fair`.  
EnzymeML documents can be read, edited, and written via the Python API PyEnzyme, providing the possibility to integrate PyEnzyme in Python data analysis workflows.

### 1.1 Creation of EnzymeML documents

EnzymeML documents were created using the EnzymeML Excel template, in combination with the `.fromTemplate()` method of PyEnzyme. Within the spreadsheet, data and metadata of an experiment can be be filled in the respective sheets. Alternatively, only metadata was entered to the spreadsheet, whereas measurement data was parsed by a custom Python function from the output file of the analytical device to the measurement data section of the EnzymeML document.

## CaliPytion

CaliPytion was developed to provide an easy way to fit linear and non linear calibration equations to estimate concentrations of analytical raw data based on standard measurements.

### Data model for calibration data

The standard curve functionality of CaliPythion is based on a data model, structuring data and metadata of calibration measurements. Thereby, calibration conditions like temperature and pH, and information of the analytical device can be provided. Furthermore, the name as well as an ID can be specified for the analyzed substance. All of this information is stored in the `Calibration` root object. Additionally, the root object can contain a `Standard` and a `Spectrum`. A `Standard` contains measurements of multiple predefined concentrations and a wavelength at which the measurement was conducted in case of spectrophotometry. A `Spectrum` can be defined by providing measurement data as well as the respective wavelengths at which the data was measured.

### Linear and non-linear fitting of calibration equations

Finds optimal model parameters through non-linear least squares fitting of experimental data to models
Since no true model from the relation between ..., and calibrations ar known to not always be linear

the following equations were implemented

```{math}
:label: linear
A = ax
```

```{math}
:label: quadratic
A = ax^2 + bx
```

```{math}
:label: 3rd_polynominal
A = ax^3 + bx^2 + cx
```

```{math}
:label: poly_e
A = ae^{\frac{b}{x}}
```

```{math}
:label: fractional
A = \frac{ax}{b+x}
```

When a `StandardCurve` is created, the measurement data, which is defined in `Calibration` is used to fit the listed calibration model equations to the data. The model, which represents the relation between analytical signal and concentration the best, is determined based on the lowest Akaike information criterion (AIC). Concentrations are calculated by calculating the root of the fitted calibration model.  
After `StandardCurve` initialization, concentrations can be calculated by calling the `get_concentration()` method. Alternatively, a `StandardCurve` can be directly applied to an `EnzymeMLDocument` by calling the `apply_to_EnzymeML()` method

```python
product_standard = StandardCurve()
enzmldoc_absorption = EnzymeMLDocument()

enzmldoc_concentration = product_standard.apply_to_EnzymeML(
    enzmldoc=enzmldoc_absorption,
    species_id="s1")
```

(method:enzymepynetics)=

## EnzymePynetics

EnzymePynetics is a a python package, for kinetic parameter estimation of single-substrate enzyme reactions, which was developed during this thesis. The `ParameterEstimator` of EnzymePynetics estimates the turnover rate $k_{cat}$ and Michaelis-Menten constant $K_{m}$ by fitting time-course measurement data of enzyme reactions to different Michaelis-Menten models. Thereby, the residuals between measurement data and integrated Michaelis-Menten rate equations are minimized through a non-linear least-squares algorithm. Additionally, the inhibition constant $K_{i}$ can be assessed for potential substrate or product inhibition. Furthermore, $K_{i}$ of an enzyme inhibitor apart from substrate or product can be determined.

### Data model

#TODO algorithm
EnzymePynetics is based on a data model, resembling the experimental design of an enzyme kinetics assay. Thereby, all relevant data and metadata of an kinetic experiment are structured in the base object `EnzymeKineticsExperiment`.
Reaction conditionas and data

#TODO On the metadata side, the base object consists of the attributes temperature with its respective unit, pH, and the name of the measured substance. Additionally, it can be specified whether the measurement data originates from substrate or product measurements. On the data side, `EnzymeKineticsExperiment` contains one or multiple `Measurements`. Each measurement stores the information of an experimental conditions oth the enzyme reaction. Therefore, each `Measurement` contains information on the initial substrate concentration, enzyme concentration, and inhibitor concentration, along with the respective concentration units. Each `Measurement` contains measured data, which itself consist of one or multiple replicates of the respective experimental condition.  
The data model was generated using [sdRDM](https://github.com/JR-1991/software-driven-rdm), a python tool allowing the creation and versioning of data models.

An extensive documentation of the data model can be accessed in the [specifications](https://github.com/haeussma/EnzymePynetics/blob/main/specifications/EnzymeKinetics.md) of the the software package.

### 3.3 Kinetic models

Besides the irreversible Michaelis-Menten rate equation (Eq. 1) inhibition models for competitive (Eq. 2), uncompetitive (Eq. 3), and non-competitive inhibition (Eq. 4) were implemented. Thereby, $S$, $E$, and $I$ respectively denote the concentration of substrate, enzyme, and inhibitor. In terms of kinetic parameters, $k_{cat}$ denotes the turnover number, $K_{m}$ the Michaelis-Menten constant of the substrate, whereas $K_{ic}$ and $K_{iu}$ respectively describe the competitive and uncompetitive inhibition constant.

```{math}
:label: irreversible_mm
\frac{dS}{dt} = -\frac{k_{cat} * E * S}{K_{m} + S}
```

```{math}
:label: competitive_inhibition
\frac{dS}{dt} = -\frac{k_{cat} * E * S}{K_{m} * (1+\frac{I}{K_{ic}}) + S}
```

```{math}
:label: uncompetitive_inhibition
\frac{dS}{dt} = -\frac{k_{cat} * E * S}{K_{m} * (1+\frac{I}{K_{iu}}) * S}
```

```{math}
:label: noncompetitive_inhibition
\frac{dS}{dt} = -\frac{k_{cat} * E * S}{K_{m} * (1+\frac{I}{K_{ic}}) + (1+\frac{I}{K_{iu}}) + S}
```

By default, $E$ is assumed to be constant throughout the reaction. If required, the kinetic models can be extended by the parameter $k_{inact}$, which describes the time-dependent inactivation rate of the enzyme. The decrease in active enzyme is modeled by Eq. 5:

```{math}
:label: enzyme_inactivation
\frac{dE}{dt} = -k_{inact} * E
```

### 3.4 Initialization

Whereas the `EnzymeKineticsExperiment` object solely serves as data container,
the `ParameterEstimator` harbors the functionalities for parameter estimation. Data can be provided by passing data as an `EnzymeKineticsExperiment` object. Alternatively, an EnzymeML documents can be provided as the data source via PyEnzyme. #TODO conservation of mass
Initially, product concentration is calculated, if the input data originates from substrate measurements and substrate concentrations are calculated, if product data is provided. The calculation of the missing species is based on the initial substrate concentration, which needs to be provided for all measurements.
The parameter estimation is based on substrate data.  
In the background, rough estimates for $k_{cat}$, $K_{m}$, and $K_{i}$ are calculated based on the highest reaction rate in the dataset. Initial parameter estimates are needed as a starting point for the solver, whereas the parameter space is limited to Â±1000-fold of the initial parameter estimates.

```python
from EnzymePynetics.tools.parameterestimator import ParameterEstimator
from EnzymePynetics.core.enzymekineticsexperiment import EnzymeKineticsExperiment
import pyenzyme

# Define data
experimental_data = EnzymeKineticsExperiment(
    pH=7,
    reactant_name="test substance",
    ...)

enzymeml_document = pyenzyme.EnzymeMLDocument.fromFile("enzymeML_dataset.omex")

# Initialize the parameter estimator from an 'EnzymeKineticsExperiment' instance
estimator = ParameterEstimator(data=experimental_data)

# ... or directly from an EnzymeML document.
estimator = ParameterEstimator.from_EnzymeML(
    enzmldoc=enzymeml_document,
    reactant_id="s1",
    measured_species="product",
    inhibitor_id="s2")

# Fit experimental data to kinetic models and get the fit report of all models
estimator.fit_models()

# Visualize data with the best fitting model
estimator.visualize()
```

### 3.5 Model selection

since the implemented models have a different number of parameters, Akaike information criterion (AIC) was used to compare the quality of fit between models. AIC is a statistical metric for qualitative model comparison for a given dataset, penalizes which for ag
