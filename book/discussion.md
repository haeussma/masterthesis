## Data management

In this project, a robust and FAIR workflow from analytical raw-data to kinetic parameters was established. Thereby, the output of a analytical device was used directly as the input of the modeling pipeline.

Despite the robust workflow, after the data is written to an EnzymeML document, manual copying of data into the EnzymeML spreadsheet is prone to human error. Especially, for large datasets with many time points and reactants. Hence, manufacturers should enable direct access to the measurement device, for instance via an API. (Control and laer experiments)

Despite the easy applicability of the workflow, after the data is initialized,
