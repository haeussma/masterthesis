# Introduction

Reproducible research is the cornerstone of scientific advances and builds the core principle of the scientific method itself. Within the last decade, an increasing number of reports raised attention on unreproducible results across various scientific discipline {cite}`begley2015reproducibility`. Reportedly, more than 70 % of researchers were not able to reproduce the results of another researcher, whereas more than 50 % were not able to reproduce their own findings {cite}`baker2016reproducibility`.
Since reproducibility is a non-standardized term, it often serves as a vague umbrella term for mingling (i) repeatable analysis based on given information by the same scientist, (ii) reproducible analysis based on given information by another scientist, or (iii) replicable analysis with new information by another scientist.
Therefore, reproducibility is not an absolute term but rather relative, depending on the scope of the notion {cite}`goodman2016does`. Goodman et. al. proposed to combine the word reproducibility with its relative scope, hence subdividing reproducibility in methods reproducibility, results reproducibility, and inferential reproducibility. According to Goodman, 'methods reproducibility refers to the provision of enough detail about study procedures and data so the same procedures could, in theory or in actuality, be exactly repeated.'. Results reproducibility requires methodological reproducibility, whereas same results are obtained from an independent study. Inferential reproducibility is given, if qualitatively similar conclusions are drawn based on the results of independent studies or reanalysis of a given study. Therefore, inferential reproducibility constitutes the highest level of reproducibility.

## Experimental reproducibility advances in data handling

With regard to biocatalysis, all laboratory as well as data analytic procedures, need to be described for methodological reproducibility. Thereby, laboratory procedures include protocols how reagents as well as biological materials were crated, as well as protocols on measurement procedures. For that purpose, the STRENDA guidelines were developed, which define minimum reporting standards for enzyme experiments. The [guidelines](https://www.beilstein-institut.de/en/projects/strenda/guidelines/) specify

Same applies for kinetic parameter results from enzyme kinetics experiments. Kinetic parameters stand at the end of a long chain of experimental and analytical steps. Whereas upcoming methods open new possibilities in biochemical research. In consequence, latterp art is becomeing mer important. Still in scientific reporting not allowing reproduce the results, since journals

The lack of raw data is therefore described as one of the reasons for the reproducibility crisis {cite}`miyakawa2020no`.

Whereas procedures of wet-lab experiments are commonly described in a sufficient manner to technically repeat the experiment, data analysis procedures are not.

According to Miyakawa et. al., 'absence of raw data means the absence of science' {cite}`miyakawa2020no`
