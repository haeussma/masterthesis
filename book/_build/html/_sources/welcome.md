# Welcome to my master thesis

This JupyterBook constitutes my master thesis. It contains multiple Jupyter Notebooks in which I applied the workflow for kinetic parameter estimation of enzyme reactions research scenarios of the EnzymeML project.

Except for this page and the capability to execute Jupyter Notebooks, the printed version is identical to this JupyterBook.
