# Abstract

This dataset builds the master thesis with the title 'From raw data to kinetic parameters: an EnzymeML-based workflow for reproducible enzyme kinetics'.
The thesis contains four different research scenarios, in which kinetic parameter were estimated by a reproducible modeling workflow based on EnzymeML.

In this work, a workflow for kinetic parameter estimation of single substrate enzyme reactions was developed, enabling a continuous data flow from raw data of absorption measurements to kinetic parameters.
For this purpose, two Python modules were developed and published on PyPI: CaliPytion facilitating precise calculation of concentrations by identifying the best linear or non-linear calibration equations, which best describes the relation between analytical signal and analyte concentration. EnzymePynetics is a Python module for kinetic parameter estimation. Thereby, ...inhibition studies
