# Methods

## 1. EnzymeML

In its core, EnzymeML is a data model, structuring data and meta data of biocatalytic reactions. Thereby, properties of the reaction vessel, molecules involved in the reaction, as well as reaction properties like stoichiometry, pH, and temperature can be documented. Furthermore, properties of the protein catalyst like sequence, EC-number, UniProt ID can be stored alongside of potential reaction modifiers like inhibitory molecules.  
Within the measurements section of the data model, measurement data of one or multiple measurements is stored. Each measurement contains data of identical measurement conditions as well as information about these conditions. Thus, data and meta data from experiments with differing conditions can be stored in a structured way.

The data model consists of descriptions for the reaction vessel,
