# Introduction

Scientific knowledge is rooted on reproducible evidence for a hypothesis. Without precise description of each step involved in process of evidence formation, it cannot be reproduced. Same applies for kinetic parameter results from enzyme kinetics experiments. Kinetic parameters stand at the end of a long chain of experimental and analytical steps. Whereas upcoming methods open new possibilities in biochemical research. In consequence, latterp art is becomeing mer important. Still in scientific reporting not allowing reproduce the results, since journals

Whereas procedures of wet-lab experiments are commonly described in a sufficient manner to technically repeat the experiment, data analysis procedures are not.

- Reproducibility crisis
  - misspractive of science HARKing p-hacking, selective reporting, poor research design
  - lack of raw data
  - definition of reproducibility repeatability repipapo
- Kinetic parameter estimation of enzyme reactions
- Biology and big data
